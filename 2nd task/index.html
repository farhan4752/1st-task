            I arranged a 3-days and 4-nights trip at Saint Martin island. I was influenced to make a trip there from an elder brother of my campus. He is a hodophile, just like me. Saint Martin is prohibited for tourist gatherings from April to September. We started to plan the budget for this trip from November 18 I hosted a public event on social media for the interested tourists to join with us and got a tremendous response. 55 People booked for the trip. Lastly, 40 people from different backgrounds, Mostly my fellow classmates, joined in.

        is a popular tourist destination. During the tourist season, 5 yachts and cruise ships available in route linking the mainland and island of Bangladesh every day. To appreciate its enchanting beauty, one night is never enough. It is better to have two nights. But it's for sure, if you traveled here once in your lifetime, it will lure you again. On the first day, You can enjoy the Chera Dwip. And another day of the trip can be allocated to St. Martin. Every day tourists return in the afternoon. So the experience of visiting the island in the afternoon is quite different. And if you happen to visit the island on a full moon night, prepare to face the fascination of staying more.

        with my friends, Rakibul Islam Plabon and Anaeth Ullah Rafi. They helped me a lot to organize the trip. As our semester final exam was on-going, we shared our parts of work. Rafi was a great help in hotel & cruise pre-booking, promotion, and others. In the meantime, I, along with Rakibul, managed the Bus Tickets.
