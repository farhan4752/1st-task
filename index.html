        <h2>My experience of a thrilling trip to SAINT MARTIN ISLAND</h2>
        <p>
            <strong><span>In 2018,</span></strong> I arranged a 3-days and 4-nights trip at Saint Martin island. I was influenced to make a trip there from an elder brother of my campus. He is a hodophile, just like me. Saint Martin is prohibited for tourist gatherings from April to September. We started to plan the budget for this trip from November 18 I hosted a public event on social media for the interested tourists to join with us and got a tremendous response. 55 People booked for the trip. Lastly, 40 people from different backgrounds, Mostly my fellow classmates, joined in.  
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong><span>St. Martin's island</span></strong>, the only coral island in Bangladesh, located in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh. St. Martin's Island is located about 9 km south of Teknaf in Cox's Bazar district and 8 km west of the coast of Myanmar at the mouth of the Naf River. It is also locally known as Narikel Jinjira because of the abundance of coconuts. Many years ago, in unfavorable weather conditions, an Arabian merchant ship carrying Daru Chini(Cinnamon) crashed into a huge rock under the water, causing the cinnamon to spread throughout the island, later renamed St. Martin's Island as 'Cinnamon' Island.

            <strong><span>St. Martin's island</span></strong> is a popular tourist destination. During the tourist season, 5 yachts and cruise ships available in route linking the mainland and island of Bangladesh every day. To appreciate its enchanting beauty, one night is never enough. It is better to have two nights. But it's for sure, if you traveled here once in your lifetime, it will lure you again. On the first day, You can enjoy the Chera Dwip. And another day of the trip can be allocated to St. Martin. Every day tourists return in the afternoon. So the experience of visiting the island in the afternoon is quite different. And if you happen to visit the island on a full moon night, prepare to face the fascination of staying more.

            <strong><span>I built up a team</span></strong> with my friends, Rakibul Islam Plabon and Anaeth Ullah Rafi. They helped me a lot to organize the trip. As our semester final exam was on-going, we shared our parts of work. Rafi was a great help in hotel & cruise pre-booking, promotion, and others. In the meantime, I, along with Rakibul, managed the Bus Tickets.

            <strong><span>St. Martin is quite</span></strong> a long way from Dhaka. The main cost of this trip has gone mostly on bus fare and cruise booking. We managed a local hotel in a quite busy tourist schedule with an extra charge. Some guardians and family members joined us. And we managed our vitamin-sea lover professor with us for guidance.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong><span>We fall in high traffic</span></strong> on the Dhaka-Cumilla highway. We have many wrongdoings during the whole trip. Some of our travelers came to the bus stand after one hour before departure time. We booked the entire bus. That's why It was not a significant issue. The last cruise of Taknaf departed at 10.30 am. There are some unwanted issues like high traffic, unconstructed roads, two breaking stops for refreshment, and many others. We lost  2 hours in long night traffic. Then the bus was going smoothly and fast. At 3 am, the back wheel of the bus was punctured. We lost another 60 minutes there to repair. Our bus driver was trying to motivate us that we will not miss the yacht. But, we missed the last one for a few minutes' delay.
